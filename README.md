## Reflection

This application is largely incomplete. I'm not sure where things went wrong, but I understood all of the concepts being taught in class and was able to handle in-class activities fairly well; however, every single step of designing this app had some kind of issue or roadblock.

In some cases, I had to almost completely start over and delete entire plans just to restart my component structure only to hit another roadblock. It's been very frustrating and I really wish I was able to understand how to achieve what's being asked here.
